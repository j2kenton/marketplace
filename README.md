# Marketplace App

This is a mobile marketplace application built with React Native and Expo.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (or yarn)
- Expo CLI

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd marketplace
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the App

To run the app on different platforms, use the following commands:

### Android

```bash
npm run android
```

### iOS

```bash
npm run ios
```

### Web

```bash
npm run web
```

### Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will open the Expo Dev Tools in your browser, where you can choose to run the app on an emulator or a physical device. I suggest simply typing "w" to run on web for quick testing using browser dev tools.
